This week, I mainly completed three tasks: checking the Linux environment, running a C program with GCC, and uploading screenshots to the Git repository. First, I verified that the Linux system was working properly and checked the installed software. Then I used GCC to compile a simple C program and successfully ran it, which helped me understand the basic process of compiling and executing code. After that, I tried to upload my screenshots to the team’s Git repository. I used commands like  git add  and  git commit , but when I ran  git push , I encountered a network connection problem and an authentication failure. I was confused about why the push didn’t work and how to enter the correct password or token. I also didn’t understand whether I needed to be added as a collaborator or if I should use a Pull Request to submit my files. These are the parts I am still not familiar with, and I plan to practice more and ask my classmates for help. Now the problem has been resolved.
