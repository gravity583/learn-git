This week, I mainly self-studyed the configuration and operation of hpl and hpcg on the Linux system, and tried the single-core and multi-core modes of hpl, and hpcg will have relatively large problems when running, because the operation of hpcg has relatively high requirements for memory, running 4-core 128*128 *When the matrix of 128 is too small, it will report an error and terminate the process, and a standard hpcg needs 1800 seconds, that is, 30 minutes, so you need to wait. The main point that needs to be mastered in the learning process is to be clear about the parameters of the dat file, and to know which parameters to change will affect the results. Moreover, I did not use the minimum scale when running hpl, but tried large-scale single-core and multi-core calculations. The result is indeed better in the final result of multi-core calculation.
