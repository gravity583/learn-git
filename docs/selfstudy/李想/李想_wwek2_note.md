WHAT I DO
  This week, I configured and ran HPL. First, I downloaded OpenMPI via wget and set up its environment. Next, I installed OpenBLAS using git clone. Due to the excessively high version of gcc, I downgraded it to gcc11 to avoid certain issues. Finally, I compiled HPL.dat to configure the parameters and ran HPL
THE PROBLEMS AND UNFAMILLIAR PARTS
  The part I'm not very familiar with is the configuration parameters for HPL, as I haven't fully figured out some of them. Since downloading HPL took me four days, with a significant amount of time spent on the download, I'm still a bit unfamiliar with HPL. I'm also not entirely clear on how the available memory size affects the configuration parameters.
